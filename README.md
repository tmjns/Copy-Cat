# Copy-Cat
A basic Python class for saving your clipboard content into a .txt file. Only raw text for now. Once you run the script it will store the content of the clipboard as long as you run it.

### Run:
Run ```python3 cc.py``` in your terminal. Kill process with ```Ctrl + C``` or just type 
```python
exit()
```
